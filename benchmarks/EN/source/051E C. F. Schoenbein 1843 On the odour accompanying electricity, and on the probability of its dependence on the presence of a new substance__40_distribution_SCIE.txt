The authorâ€™s attention having been long directed to the remarkable fact, that odour, resembling that of phosphorus, is given off during the escape of positive electricity from the point of a conductor into air; and is likewise perceptible when lightning has struck any object, and also when water is electrolyzed, he has investigated the circumstances attending these phenomena; and the results he has obtained will, he expects, afford a clue to the discovery of their cause. The odour which accompanies the electrolyzation of water, he observes, is only disengaged at the positive electrode. He also finds that the odoriferous principle can be preserved in well-closed glass bottles for any length of time. The only metals which yield this odour are gold and platina; but dilute sulphuric, phosphoric, and nitric acids, and from aqueous solutions of several of the salts, also disengage it. Raising the temperature of the fluid to the boiling point prevents the odour from arising; and the addition of comparatively small quantities of powdered charcoal, iron, zinc, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth or arsenic, or of a few drops of mercury, to the odorous principle contained in a bottle, immediately destroys the smell; and the same happens when platina or gold, heated red hot, is introduced into the vessel containing that volatile substance.
